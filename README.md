piston-dependencies
===================

## This project is unusable for the time being.

For this package to be fully functional, we will require the folling Cargo
features.

* Passing environment variables to packages
* Specifying an order for build packages

##

A Cargo package that compiles the raw C and C++ libraries that various Piston Projects depend on.


These libraries are:

* GLFW
* SDL2
* PortAudio
* SDL2-ttf
* SDL2-mixer
